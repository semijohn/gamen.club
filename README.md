Encryption is a process that transforms data into a secure format, making it unreadable to unauthorized users. This is achieved using algorithms and cryptographic keys, which ensure that only those with the correct key can decrypt and access the original data. Encryption is essential in protecting sensitive information, such as personal data, financial transactions, and communications, from cyber threats. Common encryption methods include **symmetric encryption** (where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption) and **asymmetric encryption** (which uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption). Modern encryption techniques, like **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard) and **RSA**, are widely used in securing data transmission over the internet, ensuring privacy and data integrity across various platforms. Without encryption, sensitive data would be vulnerable to hacking, identity theft, and unauthorized access.
